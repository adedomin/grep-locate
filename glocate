# Faster, user-space oriented locate and updatedb.
# System wide usage as root may expose "hidden" files.
# System wide usage (root) will store the db in /var/lib.
# if users don't have their own db, they will use this one.
#
# To ignore certain dirs, you can set a global /etc/updatedb-ignore
# which contains find style path patterns to directories.
# the user can also use $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/updatedb-ignore or
# $HOME/.config/updatedb-ignore to accomplish the same thing.
# e.g.: */.git
# e.g.: /home/username
# See the manpage for your `find` command 
# for details about the -path option and the patterns it takes.
